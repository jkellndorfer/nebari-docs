This guide is intended to walk new users through the process of getting started
using Nebari as a development platform. You may be here as a software developer,
or

## Logging into Nebari

To get started, we'll begin by navigating to the Nebari URL. Once there, you
can click on `Sign in with Keycloak`.

![Front page of nebari with button to sign in with keycloak](/img/get-started/101-front-page.png)

This will take you to to [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) for
authentication. Depending on how your admin has set up authentication, you may
need to log in with a username and password, [auth0](https://auth0.com/), or
[GitHub](https://github.com/). You may also be able to register for access
via Keycloak if your admin has allowed that feature.

![Login screen for keycloak](/img/get-started/101-keycloak-login.png)

Once you proceed through the Keycloak login, you will be redirected back to
the main Nebari instance homepage. Click on `Start My Server` to see the list
of available servers.

Select a server size, then click `Start` to launch your server.

When you launch a new server, unless you are using a local cluster, Nebari will
go through the process of spinning up a new pod and building the docker image
which will be running inside the pod. This may take a few moments, so be
patient :wink:

Once the server is ready, you'll be redirected to the
[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) interface.

Congrats :tada: ! You are ready to get to work!

## Working on Nebari

Nebari has many different integrations that are provided out-of-the-box. We
encourage you to explore the available integrations and see what might be
useful to you.

:seedling: Environments are served via the [conda-store](https://conda.store/) UI. It's
definitely worth it to check out the tutorial on
[Creating New Environments](/docs/tutorials/creating-new-environments).

:seedling: Another popular topic is the guide on [Using Visual Studio (VS) Code](/docs/how-tos/using-vscode).

:seedling: If you work with Machine Learning models, you may be interested in the ClearML
integration, providing MLOps to help you manage and compare your model simulations.

:seedling: If you need a workflow manager, check out [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)!

:seedling: Both admins and other devs can find usage for Grafana dashboards to assist with
data monitoring.
